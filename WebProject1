    		<h1>A Time to Learn and Reflect</h1>
          
       		<h3>Given the current global climate, my time now has been filled with perhaps the most key learning moments in my life. Here are some of the many things Ive learned </h3>
          
        	<h4> Self Discipline</h4>
        
        	<p>With Social distancing being top priority for many, reduced social interactions and the expectation of staying indoors could cause many to lose themselves. lose the drive to commit to working out, finish school, eat healthy... I'm speaking from experience when I say this, and that is why I made it a priority to practice self discipline during this time-- perhaps even more than before starting out small, and slowly adding new things to my daily routine.</p>
        
        	<p>Every day I do the following: </p>
        
        	<ol>
        
        		<li>Wake up at a set time (9 A.M)</li>
            
            		<br />
            
            		<li>Write all that I am grateful for.</li>

			<br />
            
            		<li>Drink a shot of ginger in the morning</li>
            
            		<br />
            
        		<li>Work out, or stay physically active in some shape or form</li>
            
      	 		<br/>
          
      	    		<li>Try to Minimize binge eating  habits by listening to my body, and not my sugar cravings.</li>
          
       	    		<br/>
         
       	    		<li>Clean/rearrange my room. Sounds basic, I know, but having time really makes a difference. I wouldn’t say I was living in a pigsty, as I’m fairly a neat freak, but I actually have time to do what I’ve always pushed off ( like color coordinating my clothes, rearrange the bed, decorate the walls, etc).</li>
        
        	</ol>
        
   		<h4>Staying occupied throughout the day</h4>
        
        	<p>Social media feels a bit lackluster now that everyone is on it almost every second of the day,  So finding ways to occupy my time in a way that makes me feel happy, and productive at the end of the day has been really important to me. Ive done a couple of things to pass time:</p>
        
        	<ol>
        
        		<li> Relearn to show gratitude and be more intentional in my own life and my friends’ lives. I’ve done so by writing all the things that I am grateful for. It was extremely hard at first but it started to get easier to see all the things I am fortunate enough to have, especially in this climate. I also make a larger effort to reach out the people who are important to me whether it be through Facetime, text, group movie night, virtual game night etc…</li>
            
            		<br />
            
           		<li> Cook new meals. With the new free delivery on door dash, I was EXTREMELY tempted to order in whenever I could. Remembering that this could be a great time to cut fast food cravings and, instead, take the time to cook my own food was major. I’ve been making my own meals throughout the day and helping my mom out whenever I can when it comes to food prep. I’ve learned how to make 9 new dishes which is significantly more than the measly 3 I rotated 4 months ago(go me!).</li>
            
           		<br />
            
            		<li> Learn new techniques in makeup. I love all things hair and makeup, but I there is so much I can learn in each department. I’ve taken time to challenge myself and recreate some of my favorite makeup looks(with eyeshadow) which is NOT easy. At all. Some looked a bit shaky but some came out really nice.</li>
            
            		<br />
            
            		<li> Learn to sew by hand. I had a sewing machine that I never used which stopped working miraculously (must have been all the dust from non-use) so I challenged myself to make due with what resources I do have: a needle, thread, and some fabric, and have been making small pieces since!</li>
            
      		</ol>
      
      		<p>I know this time may be tough for many of you, but I hope this helps, and prompts you to make the most of your time. I encourage you to do the things you put on the back burner due to lack of time, and find ways to make yourself feel fulfilled and at peace! \ (•◡•) /</p>
